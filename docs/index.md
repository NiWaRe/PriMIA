## About
PriMIA is an extensible library for end-to-end privacy preserving machine learning on medical images. It provides command line scripts for federated training of convolutional neural networks and for encrypted inference.

## Use Cases
PriMIA is designed with flexibility and ease of access in mind. It's suitable for beginners, who want to experiment with privacy preserving machine learning and scales all the way up to cloud instance training on real-life medical datasets. It incorporates all the state-of-the-art methods from [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) and [CrypTen](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CrypTen) and extends them with functionality especially tailored to medical images.
