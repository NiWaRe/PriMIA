## About
PriMIA is a framework for end-to-end privacy preserving machine learning on medical images designed and built at the Technical University of Munich, OpenMined and Imperial College London. It enables you to do federated training of convolutional neural networks and encrypted inference from a simple command-line interface.

## Use Cases
PriMIA is designed with flexibility and accessibility in mind. It's suitable for beginners just starting out their experimentation with privacy preserving machine learning and can scale up to decentralised cloud instance training on real-life medical datasets. We incorporate current state-of-the-art privacy preservation methods from [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) and extend them with functionality tailored to medical images.

## How to get started
To train a model on a real-life medical dataset, just clone the repository, install the dependencies (documentation [here](HowTo.md)) and run:

```bash
make symbolic_server_folders

python train.py --config configs/torch/pneumonia-resnet-pretrained.ini 
--train_federated --data_dir data/server_simulation
```

PriMIA will train a ResNet18 using federated learning on PySyft VirtualWorkers and return the model weights and metrics in `model_weights`.

Then just run: 

```bash
python inference.py --model_weights <path/to/weights.pt> 
--encrypted_inference --data_dir <path/to/test_images>
```
And PriMIA will return end-to-end encrypted predictions on the test set using _Function Secret Sharing_!

We also provide many more options, such as other models, working with MNIST for weaker machines, turning on and off various privacy-enhancing technologies, hyperparameter search for the whole federation and a gamut of choices, all easy to implement via a single `.ini` file. To have a look at some more recipes, go to [this page](HowTo.md)!
