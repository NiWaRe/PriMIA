Rationale: Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children, mostly in the developing world, with nearly 80% of paediatric deaths attributable to the disease in children under 2. In symptomatic children, chest X-Rays are indicated for differential diagnosis and ruling out causes such as foreign body aspiration. Since rapid diagnosis of the condition is predicated upon radiologist availability, which is limited in the developing world, solutions for automated evaluation of chest X-Rays are required. Here we present a privacy-preserving training and inference solution for paediatric chest X-Rays based on federated learning and secure computation.
The novelty of our work is twofold: Paediatric images are not immediately comparable to adult X-Rays due to physiological and technical differences, especially the application of Aluminium or Copper filters with a reduction in image quality and the elimination of scatter grids leading to blur. More importantly, we here show an end-to-end solution which does not require sharing plain-text private patient information either during training or during inference based entirely on open-source tools. The proof of concept presented here can be used to offer radiological assistance to remote areas in a privacy-preserving manner.
